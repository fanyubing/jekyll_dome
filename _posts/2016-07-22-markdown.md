## <center>markdown 使用总结<center/>

#### Inline code and Block code

Inline code are surround by `backtick` key. To create a block code:

	Indent each line by at least 1 tab, or 4 spaces.
    var Mou = exactlyTheAppIwant; 
#### Fenced Code Blocks

Start with a line containing 3 or more backticks, and ends with the first line with the same number of backticks:

```
Fenced code blocks are like Stardard Markdown’s regular code
blocks, except that they’re not indented and instead rely on
a start and end fence lines to delimit the code block.

#### Tables

A simple table looks like this:

First Header | Second Header | Third Header
------------ | ------------- | ------------
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell

If you wish, you can add a leading and tailing pipe to each line of the table:

| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |

```
### ps: markdown文件中可以嵌入html标签，直接执行<br/>
所以，我们可以添加换行，设置样式，甚至使用css
